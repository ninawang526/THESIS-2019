      "[u'\"WASHINGTON \\u2014 Congressional Republicans have a new fear when it comes to their health care lawsuit against the Obama administration: They might win.', u'The incoming Trump administration could choose to no longer defend the executive branch against the suit, which challenges the administration\\u2019s authority to spend billions of dollars on health insurance subsidies for and Americans, handing House Republicans a big victory on issues.', u'But a sudden loss of the disputed subsidies could conceivably cause the health care program to implode, leaving millions of people without access to health insurance before Republicans have prepared a replacement.', u'That could lead to chaos in the insurance market and spur a political backlash just as Republicans gain full control of the government.', u'To stave off that outcome, Republicans could find themselves in the awkward position of appropriating huge sums to temporarily prop up the Obama health care law, angering conservative voters who have been demanding an end to the law for years.', u'In another twist, Donald J. Trump\\u2019s administration, worried about preserving executive branch prerogatives, could choose to fight its Republican allies in the House on some central questions in the dispute.', u'Eager to avoid an ugly political pileup, Republicans on Capitol Hill and the Trump transition team are gaming out how to handle the lawsuit, which, after the election, has been put in limbo until at least late February by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.', u'They are not yet ready to divulge their strategy.', u'\\u201cGiven that this pending litigation involves the Obama administration and Congress, it would be inappropriate to comment, \\u201d said Phillip J. Blando, a spokesman for the Trump transition effort.', u'\\u201cUpon taking office, the Trump administration will evaluate this case and all related aspects of the Affordable Care Act.', u'\\u201d In a potentially decision in 2015, Judge Rosemary M. Collyer ruled that House Republicans had the standing to sue the executive branch over a spending dispute and that the Obama administration had been distributing the health insurance subsidies, in violation of the Constitution, without approval from Congress.', u'The Justice Department, confident that Judge Collyer\\u2019s decision would be reversed, quickly appealed, and the subsidies have remained in place during the appeal.', u'In successfully seeking a temporary halt in the proceedings after Mr. Trump won, House Republicans last month told the court that they \\u201cand the \\u2019s transition team currently are discussing potential options for resolution of this matter, to take effect after the \\u2019s inauguration on Jan. 20, 2017.', u'\\u201d The suspension of the case, House lawyers said, will \\u201cprovide the and his future administration time to consider whether to continue prosecuting or to otherwise resolve this appeal.', u'\\u201d Republican leadership officials in the House acknowledge the possibility of \\u201ccascading effects\\u201d if the payments, which have totaled an estimated $13 billion, are suddenly stopped.', u'Insurers that receive the subsidies in exchange for paying costs such as deductibles and for eligible consumers could race to drop coverage since they would be losing money.', u'Over all, the loss of the subsidies could destabilize the entire program and cause a lack of confidence that leads other insurers to seek a quick exit as well.', u'Anticipating that the Trump administration might not be inclined to mount a vigorous fight against the House Republicans given the \\u2019s dim view of the health care law, a team of lawyers this month sought to intervene in the case on behalf of two participants in the health care program.', u'In their request, the lawyers predicted that a deal between House Republicans and the new administration to dismiss or settle the case \\u201cwill produce devastating consequences for the individuals who receive these reductions, as well as for the nation\\u2019s health insurance and health care systems generally.', u'\\u201d No matter what happens, House Republicans say, they want to prevail on two overarching concepts: the congressional power of the purse, and the right of Congress to sue the executive branch if it violates the Constitution regarding that spending power.', u'House Republicans contend that Congress never appropriated the money for the subsidies, as required by the Constitution.', u'In the suit, which was initially championed by John A. Boehner, the House speaker at the time, and later in House committee reports, Republicans asserted that the administration, desperate for the funding, had required the Treasury Department to provide it despite widespread internal skepticism that the spending was proper.', u'The White House said that the spending was a permanent part of the law passed in 2010, and that no annual appropriation was required \\u2014 even though the administration initially sought one.', u'Just as important to House Republicans, Judge Collyer found that Congress had the standing to sue the White House on this issue \\u2014 a ruling that many legal experts said was flawed \\u2014 and they want that precedent to be set to restore congressional leverage over the executive branch.', u'But on spending power and standing, the Trump administration may come under pressure from advocates of presidential authority to fight the House no matter their shared views on health care, since those precedents could have broad repercussions.', u'It is a complicated set of dynamics illustrating how a quick legal victory for the House in the Trump era might come with costs that Republicans never anticipated when they took on the Obama White House.\"']\n",
      "[u'\"After the bullet shells get counted, the blood dries and the votive candles burn out, people peer down from windows and see crime scenes gone cold: a band of yellow police tape blowing in the breeze.', u'The South Bronx, just across the Harlem River from Manhattan and once shorthand for urban dysfunction, still suffers violence at levels long ago slashed in many other parts of New York City.', u'And yet the city\\u2019s efforts to fight it remain splintered, underfunded and burdened by scandal.', u'In the 40th Precinct, at the southern tip of the Bronx, as in other poor, minority neighborhoods across the country, people long hounded for infractions are crying out for more protection against grievous injury or death.', u'By September, four of every five shootings in the precinct this year were unsolved.', u'Out of the city\\u2019s 77 precincts, the 40th has the highest murder rate but the fewest detectives per violent crime, reflecting disparities in staffing that hit hardest in some neighborhoods outside Manhattan, according to a New York Times analysis of Police Department data.', u'Investigators in the precinct are saddled with twice the number of cases the department recommends, even as their bosses are called to Police Headquarters to answer for the sharpest crime rise in the city this year.', u'And across the Bronx, investigative resources are squeezed.', u'It has the highest rate of the city\\u2019s five boroughs but the thinnest detective staffing.', u'Nine of the 14 precinct detective squads for violent crime in the city are there.', u'The borough\\u2019s robbery squad is smaller than Manhattan\\u2019s, even though the Bronx has had 1, 300 more cases this year.', u'And its homicide squad has one detective for every four murders, compared with one detective for roughly every two murders in Upper Manhattan and more than one detective per murder in Lower Manhattan.', u'In lobbies and family apartments, outside methadone clinics and art studios, people take note of the inequity.', u'They hear police commanders explain that they lack the resources to place a floodlight on a dangerous block or to post officers at a corner.', u'They watch witnesses cower behind doors, more fearful of a gunman\\u2019s crew than confident in the Police Department\\u2019s ability to protect them.', u'So though people see a lot, they rarely testify.', u'And in the South Bronx, as in so many predominantly black and Hispanic neighborhoods like it in the United States, the contract between the police and the community is in tatters.', u'Some people have stories of crime reports that were ignored, or 911 calls that went unanswered for hours.', u'Others tell of a 911 call for help ending in the caller\\u2019s arrest, or of a minor charge leading to 12 hours in a fetid holding cell.', u'This is the paradox of policing in the 40th Precinct.', u'Its neighborhoods have historically been prime targets for aggressive tactics, like that are designed to ward off disorder.', u'But precinct detectives there have less time than anywhere else in the city to answer for the blood spilled in violent crimes.', u'Gola White, who was beside her daughter when she was shot and killed in a playground this summer, four years after her son was gunned down in the same housing project, ticked off the public safety resources that she said were scant in Bronx neighborhoods like hers: security cameras, lights, locks, investigating police officers.', u'\\u201cHere, we have nothing, \\u201d she said.', u'When it comes to \\u201c families, \\u201d she said, the authorities \\u201cdon\\u2019t really care as much.', u'That\\u2019s how I feel.', u'\\u201d The Times has been documenting the murders logged this year in the 40th Precinct, one of a handful of neighborhoods where deadly violence remains a problem in an era of crime in New York City.', u'The homicides \\u2014 14 in the precinct this year, up from nine in 2015 \\u2014 strain detectives, and when they go unsolved, as half of them have this year, some look to take the law into their own hands.', u'From hundreds of conversations with grieving relatives and friends, witnesses and police officers, the social forces that flare into murder in a place like the 40th Precinct become clearer: merciless gang codes, mental illness, drugs and long memories of feuds that simmered out of officers\\u2019 view.', u'The reasons some murders will never be solved also emerge: paralyzing fear of retribution, victims carrying secrets to their graves and relentless casework that forces detectives to move on in hopes that a break will come later.', u'Frustrations build on all sides.', u'Detectives\\u2019 phones rarely ring with tips, and officers grow embittered with witnesses who will not cooperate.', u'In the meantime, a victim\\u2019s friends conduct their own investigations, and talk of grabbing a stash gun from a wheel well or a mother\\u2019s apartment when they find their suspect.', u'In the chasm between the police and the community, gangs and gun violence flourish.', u'Parents try to protect their families from drug crews\\u2019 threats, and officers work to overcome the residue of years of mistrust and understaffing in communities where they still go racing from one 911 call to the next.', u'The streets around St. Mary\\u2019s Park were the scene of two fatal shootings logged in the 40th Precinct this year.', u'Both are unsolved.', u'James Fernandez heard talk of the murders through the door of his apartment on East 146th Street in a the Betances Houses.', u'He lived at the end of a long hallway strewn with hypodermic needles, empty dope bags and discarded Hennessy bottles.', u'A young men who spoke of being in a subset of the Bloods gang had made it their drug market, slinging marijuana and cocaine to regulars, flashing firearms and blowing smoke into the Fernandez apartment.', u'When Mr. Fernandez, 40, asked the young men to move, they answered by busting up his car.', u'This kind of crime, an anachronism in much of New York, still rattles the 40th Precinct, even though murders there have fallen to 14 this year from 83 in 1991.', u'It has more major felony crimes per resident than any other residential district in the city.', u'It is also one of the poorest communities in the country, and many young men find their way into underground markets.', u'Mr. Fernandez was not one to shrink from the threats.', u'When he was growing up on the Lower East Side, he rode his bicycle around to the customers of the drug dealers he worked for and collected payments in a backpack.', u'After leaving that life, he got a tech maintenance job and, three years ago, moved into the Betances Houses with his wife and daughter, now 11.', u'He had two choices to get help with the drug crew: call the police for help and risk being labeled a snitch, or call his old Lower East Side bosses for muscle and risk violence.', u'He chose the police.', u'Again and again, he walked into a local substation, Police Service Area 7, and asked for protection.', u'His daughter was using an inhaler to relieve coughs from the marijuana smoke.', u'Mr. Fernandez and his wife got terrible headaches.', u'\\u201cThere\\u2019s a lot of killers here, and we are going to kill you, \\u201d a sergeant\\u2019s police report quoted a telling Mr. Fernandez in August 2015.', u'A second report filed the same day said a warned him, \\u201cI\\u2019m going to shoot through your window.', u'\\u201d Mr. Fernandez told the police both the teenagers\\u2019 names, which appear in the reports, and then went home.', u'He said one of their friends had seen him walk into the substation, and they tried to intimidate him out of filing another report.', u'Three days later, the same propped his bike on their door, \\u201cthen said if I was to open the door and say something, they would body slam me, \\u201d Mr. Fernandez\\u2019s wife, Maria Fernandez, wrote on slips of paper she used to document the hallway ruckus and the inadequate police response.', u'The boys made comments about how easy a target she was and about how they would have to \\u201cslap\\u201d her if she opened the door while they made a drug sale, and they threatened to beat the Fernandez family because \\u201cthey are the ones snitching, \\u201d her notes say.', u'But another complaint at the substation, 10 days after the first, brought no relief.', u'A week later, feeling desperate, Ms. Fernandez tried calling: first to the substation, at 8:50 p. m. when one of the boys blew weed smoke at her door and made a threat to attack her, and then to 911 at 10:36 p. m. The police never came, she wrote in her notes.', u'She tried the 40th Precinct station house next, but officers at the desk left her standing in the public waiting area for a she said, making her fear being seen again.', u'Officers put her in worse danger some months later, she said, when they came to her door and announced in front of the teenagers that they were there on a complaint about drug activity.', u'Mr. Fernandez started doing the work that he said the police had failed to do.', u'He wired a camera into his peephole to record the drugs and guns.', u'The footage hark back to the New York of the 1980s, still very much present to some of the precinct\\u2019s residents.', u'Around 6:30 each morning, Sgt.', u'Michael J. LoPuzzo walks through the tall wooden doors of the 40th Precinct station house.', u'The cases that land on his metal desk \\u2014 dead bodies with no known cause, strip club brawls, shooting victims hobbling into the hospital themselves \\u2014 bring resistance at every turn, reminding him of an earlier era in the city\\u2019s campaign.', u'\\u201cI haven\\u2019t got one single phone call that\\u2019s putting me in the right direction here, \\u201d said Sergeant LoPuzzo, the head of the precinct\\u2019s detective squad, one day this summer as he worked on an answer to an email inquiry from a murder victim\\u2019s aunt about why the killer had not been caught.', u'\\u201cAnd people just don\\u2019t understand that.', u'\\u201d Often it is detectives who most feel the effects of people turning on the police.', u'Witnesses shout them away from their doors just so neighbors know they refuse to talk.', u'Of the 184 people who were shot and wounded in the Bronx through early September, more than a third \\u2014 66 victims \\u2014 refused to cooperate.', u'Over the same period in the 40th Precinct, squad detectives closed three of 17 nonfatal shootings, and 72 of 343 robbery cases.', u'Part of the resistance stems from preventive policing tactics, like that were a hallmark of the style under former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and his police commissioner, Raymond W. Kelly.', u'Near the height of the strategy, in 2012, the 40th Precinct had the stops in the city, the stops in which officers used force and the most frisks.', u'Of 18, 276 stops that year, 15, 521 were of people who had done nothing criminal.', u'The precinct was also one of the areas that the department flooded with its newest officers.', u'At roll calls, they were pressured to generate numbers: write tickets and make arrests.', u'They had no choice but to give a summons to a young man playing in a park after dark, even if the officers had done the same growing up in the same neighborhood.', u'\\u201cI need to bring something in today to justify my existence, \\u201d Officer Argenis Rosado, who joined the precinct in 2010, said in an interview at the station house.', u'\\u201cSo now you\\u2019re in a small area, and day after day you\\u2019re hammering the same community.', u'Of course that community\\u2019s eventually going to turn on you.', u'\\u201d The pressure warped the way officers and residents saw each other.', u'Rookies had to ignore why someone might be drinking outside or sitting on a stoop.', u'\\u201cSome of the cops that came out at that time probably viewed the community differently, too, \\u201d said Hector Espada, a veteran of the precinct.', u'\\u201cNot because they wanted to, but because they had to.', u'Because some way or somehow, you can\\u2019t give someone a $115 summons and feel like you guys could still have a civil conversation after that.', u'\\u201d Morale wilted in the aged station house on Alexander Avenue, in Mott Haven.', u'Officers felt pressure to downgrade crime complaints to make them appear less serious.', u'Several said in interviews that they had overlooked crime reports from immigrants because they were seen as unlikely to complain, and watched supervisors badger victims into repeating their stories in hopes that they would drop their complaints.', u'The practice of downgrading complaints resulted in the disciplining of 19 officers in the precinct last year, one in a string of scandals that has left officers there feeling overscrutinized for problems that also existed elsewhere.', u'Four commanders in the precinct were sent packing in five years, one of them after officers were found to be \\u201cticket fixing, \\u201d or forgiving parking tickets for friends, and another after he was recorded giving guidance on whom to stop and frisk: black boys and men, ages 14 to 21.', u'Some officers fled to other commands.', u'Others became reluctant to take assignments in proactive policing units, like that put them in situations on the street.', u'\\u201cWhenever I walked through the doors of the precinct, to me, it seemed like a black cloud, \\u201d said Russell Lewis, a of the 40th.', u'\\u201cIt was like a heaviness.', u'When you walked in, all you wanted to do was do your 8 hours 35 minutes and go home, because you didn\\u2019t want to get caught up in anything.', u'\\u201d The precinct covers only about two square miles, but the more than a dozen housing projects there mean that it overflows with people.', u'Methadone clinics draw addicts from around the city.', u'lofts on the southern edge of the precinct presage a wave of gentrification.', u'Even as the Police Department has hired 1, 300 more officers for neighborhood policing and counterterrorism, officers in the 40th Precinct said they could still rush to 25 911 calls during a shift \\u2014 a number unchanged from what the new police commissioner, James P. O\\u2019Neill, said he was handling in a similar South Bronx precinct 15 years ago.', u'Several dozen calls at a time can be waiting for a response.', u'Residents know that if you want the police for a domestic problem, it helps to hint that there is a weapon.', u'Last year, the precinct drew the number of civilian complaints for officer misconduct in the city, and the most lawsuits stemming from police actions.', u'The precinct is trying to improve morale under a new commanding officer, Deputy Inspector Brian Hennessy.', u'A cadre of what the department calls neighborhood coordination officers has been on patrol since last January, part of a citywide effort under Mr. O\\u2019Neill and Mayor Bill de Blasio to bring back the beat cop, unencumbered by chasing every last 911 call, who can listen to people\\u2019s concerns and help with investigations.', u'The precinct has made among the most gun arrests in the city, and officers said they now had more discretion to resolve encounters without a summons or an arrest.', u'At one corner near a school, on Courtlandt Avenue and East 151st Street, that has long spawned complaints about gunfire and fights, Inspector Hennessy and some of his officers painted over graffiti and swept up drug paraphernalia this summer.', u'People said it was the first answer to their complaints in years.', u'But the inspector acknowledged that the residue of policing lingers.', u'\\u201cThat perception really sticks, \\u201d he said.', u'The workload in the 40th Precinct is startling and reveals a gap in how detective squads are equipped to answer violent crime in Manhattan compared with the Bronx, Brooklyn and Queens.', u'Three of the precinct\\u2019s 16 detectives are carrying more than 400 cases each this year, and many others have loads in the high 300s, even though the department advises 150 in violent precincts.', u'When they are assigned a homicide, they typically have four days to investigate before dealing with other cases.', u'Quieter precincts can give detectives a month with little distraction to investigate a murder.', u'Detectives in the 40th Precinct have each handled an average of 79 violent felonies this year through \\u2014 murders, rapes, felony assaults and robberies.', u'By contrast, a detective in the precinct on the southern end of Staten Island carries nine such cases a detective in the precinct patrolling Union Square and Gramercy Park handles 16 and a detective in the precinct for most of Washington Heights handles 32, the citywide median.', u'Last year, the 40th was the for violent crime, with 65 cases per detective.', u'In the Bronx as a whole, a precinct detective has carried an average of 58 violent felonies this year, compared with 27 in Manhattan, 37 in Brooklyn, 38 in Queens and 25 on Staten Island.', u'Rape cases and robbery patterns are later sent to more specialized units, but precinct detectives do extensive initial work to interview victims, write reports and process evidence.', u'Precincts in much of Manhattan, which are whiter and wealthier than the South Bronx, often have more property felonies, like stolen laptops or credit cards, and the police say those can be complex.', u'But even accounting for those crimes, the 40th Precinct has some of the heaviest caseloads of overall crime per detective in the city.', u'Michael Palladino, the head of the Detectives\\u2019 Endowment Association and a former Bronx officer, said staffing disparities affected the department\\u2019s efforts to build trust in communities like the South Bronx.', u'Witnesses make a calculation, he said: \\u201cIf I cooperate with the detectives, there\\u2019s so much work, there\\u2019s so few of them there, they won\\u2019t even get the chance to protect me, or they\\u2019ll be there too late when the retaliation comes.', u'\\u201d Sergeant LoPuzzo, who turned down a more prestigious post to stay in the 40th Precinct, said that his squad worked tirelessly to handle cases with the people he had, and that while every squad wanted more detectives, staffing needs for counterterrorism units and task forces had created new deployment challenges across the department.', u'\\u201cWe fight with the army we have, not the army we wish we had, \\u201d he said.', u'Details of how the Police Department assigns its 36, 000 officers are closely held and constantly in flux, and the public has minimal information on how personnel are allocated.', u'Presented with The Times\\u2019s analysis of confidential staffing data, the department\\u2019s chief of detectives, Robert K. Boyce, vowed to send more detectives to the 40th Precinct and said the department would reassess its deployment more broadly in troubled precincts.', u'He said a recent decision to bring gang, narcotics and vice detectives under his command made it easier to shift personnel.', u'Chief Boyce said the burdens on detectives went beyond felony crimes to include and cases.', u'And he noted the support that precinct squads got from centralized units focusing on robberies, gangs or grand larcenies, for example.', u'Major crime keeps pounding the 40th Precinct, at rates that in 2015 were only a tenth of a percent lower than in 2001, even as citywide crime dropped by more than a third over the same period.', u'But the precinct\\u2019s detective squad shrank by about eight investigators during those years, according to staffing data obtained from the City Council through a Freedom of Information Law request.', u'The squad covering Union Square and Gramercy Park, where crime dropped by a third over that period, grew by about 11 investigators.', u'(The 40th Precinct was given an additional detective and four investigators this summer, when it was already missing three detectives for illness or other reasons.)', u'Retired detectives are skeptical that community relations alone can drive down crime in the city\\u2019s last \\u201c\\u201d the busiest precincts.', u'Rather, they say, the Police Department should be dedicating more resources to providing the same sort of robust investigative response that seems standard in Manhattan.', u'\\u201cAny crime in Manhattan has to be solved, \\u201d said Howard Landesberg, who was a 40th Precinct detective in the late 1980s.', u'\\u201cThe outer boroughs are, like, forgotten.', u'\\u201d Retired detectives said that understaffing made it harder to solve crimes in the Bronx, Brooklyn and Queens, where the higher prevalence of gang and drug killings already saddled investigators with cases in which people were not inclined to cooperate.', u'Through detectives had closed 67 percent of homicides in Manhattan and 76 percent of those in Staten Island this year, compared with 54 percent of those in the Bronx, 42 percent of those in Queens and 31 percent of those in Brooklyn.', u'Of last year\\u2019s homicides, detectives cleared 71 percent in Manhattan, 63 percent in the Bronx, 62 percent in Queens, 57 percent in Staten Island and 31 percent in Brooklyn.', u'\\u201cIt\\u2019s the culture of the Police Department that they worry about Manhattan, \\u201d said Joseph L. Giacalone, a former sergeant in the Bronx Cold Case Squad, in part \\u201cbecause that\\u2019s where the money is.', u'\\u201d He added: \\u201cWhen de Blasio came in, he talked about the tale of two cities.', u'And then he\\u2019s done the complete opposite of what he said.', u'It\\u2019s just business as usual.', u'\\u201d The Bronx\\u2019s struggles extend into prosecutions.', u'In each of the last five years, prosecutors in the Bronx have declined to prosecute violent felony cases more than anywhere else in the city.', u'And the rate of conviction in the Bronx is routinely the lowest in the city as well, but has ticked up this year to surpass Brooklyn\\u2019s rate through November as Bronx prosecutors work to streamline cases.', u'Some cases have become even more difficult to win because of the problem in the 40th Precinct, which has allowed defense lawyers to attack the credibility of officers who were implicated, said Patrice O\\u2019Shaughnessy, a spokeswoman for the Bronx District Attorney\\u2019s office.', u'The district attorney, Darcel D. Clark, elected in 2015, said in a statement, \\u201cI was a judge here in the Bronx, and I heard from jurors that they can\\u2019t be impartial because they don\\u2019t trust the police.', u'\\u201d Against that tide of mistrust, Sergeant LoPuzzo\\u2019s detectives work 36 hours straight on some fresh cases.', u'They buy Chinese takeout with their own money for a murder suspect.', u'They carry surveillance videos home in hopes that their personal computers may enhance them better than a squad computer.', u'They buy an urn for a homeless mother who has her murdered son\\u2019s ashes in a box.', u'In the months after a killing, they can seem like the only people in this glittering city who are paying attention to the 40th Precinct\\u2019s homicide victims.', u'Newly fatherless children go back to school without a therapist\\u2019s help.', u'Victims\\u2019 families wander confused through a courthouse and nearly miss an appearance.', u'Newspapers largely ignore killings of people with criminal pasts, pushing them down the priority lists of the chiefs at Police Headquarters.', u'In a stuffy squad room, the detectives of the 40th Precinct grapple with an inheritance of government neglect.', u'They meet mothers who believe their sons might never have been murdered had a city guidance counselor listened to pleas to help them stay enrolled, or had a city housing worker fixed the locks or lights on a building.', u'And the detectives work alongside a vicious system on the streets for punishing police cooperators.', u'Young men scan court paperwork in prison, looking for the names of people who turned on them.', u'One murder victim in the precinct this year was cast out of his crew after he avoided being arrested with them in a gang takedown some believed he was cooperating.', u'A longtime 40th Precinct detective, Jeff Meenagh, said a witness in a homicide case was going to testify until he went back to his neighborhood and was told that anyone who testified would \\u201cget what you deserve.', u'\\u201d The allies Sergeant LoPuzzo makes are friendly only for so long.', u'He helped clear a woman\\u2019s son of a robbery charge by locating surveillance

Trump.', u'Although North Korea has conducted five nuclear tests in the last decade and more than 20 ballistic missile tests in 2016 alone, and although it habitually threatens to attack the United States with nuclear weapons, the country has never an intercontinental ballistic missile, or ICBM.', u'In his annual New Year\\u2019s Day speech, which was broadcast on the North\\u2019s KCTV on Sunday, Mr. Kim spoke proudly of the strides he said his country had made in its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs.', u'He said North Korea would continue to bolster its weapons programs as long as the United States remained hostile and continued its joint military exercises with South Korea.', u'\\u201cWe have reached the final stage in preparations to an intercontinental ballistic rocket, \\u201d he said.', u'Analysts in the region have said Mr. Kim might conduct another weapons test in coming months, taking advantage of leadership changes in the United States and South Korea.', u'Mr. Trump will be sworn in on Jan. 20.', u'In South Korea, President Park whose powers were suspended in a Parliamentary impeachment on Dec. 9, is waiting for the Constitutional Court to rule on whether she should be formally removed from office or reinstated.', u'If North Korea conducts a test in coming months, it will test Mr. Trump\\u2019s new administration despite years of increasingly harsh sanctions, North Korea has been advancing toward Mr. Kim\\u2019s professed goal of arming his isolated country with the ability to deliver a nuclear warhead to the United States.', u'Mr. Kim\\u2019s speech on Sunday indicated that North Korea may a rocket several times this year to complete its ICBM program, said Cheong a senior research fellow at the Sejong Institute in South Korea.', u'The first of such tests could come even before Mr. Trump\\u2019s inauguration, Mr. Cheong said.', u'\\u201cWe need to take note of the fact that this is the first New Year\\u2019s speech where Kim mentioned an intercontinental ballistic missile, \\u201d he said.', u'In his speech, Mr. Kim did not comment on Mr. Trump\\u2019s election.', u'Doubt still runs deep that North Korea has mastered all the technology needed to build a reliable ICBM.', u'But analysts in the region said the North\\u2019s launchings of rockets to put satellites into orbit in recent years showed that the country had cleared some key technological hurdles.', u'After the North\\u2019s satellite launch in February, South Korean defense officials said the Unha rocket used in the launch, if successfully reconfigured as a missile, could fly more than 7, 400 miles with a warhead of 1, 100 to 1, 300 pounds \\u2014 far enough to reach most of the United States.', u'North Korea has deployed Rodong ballistic missiles that can reach most of South Korea and Japan, but it has had a spotty record in the Musudan, its ballistic missile with a range long enough to reach American military bases in the Pacific, including those on Guam.', u'The North has also claimed a series of successes in testing various ICBM technologies, although its claims cannot be verified and are often disputed by officials and analysts in the region.', u'It has said it could now make nuclear warheads small enough to fit onto a ballistic missile.', u'It also claimed success in testing the technology that allows a missile to return to the Earth\\u2019s atmosphere without breaking up.', u'In April, North Korea reported the successful ground test of an engine for an intercontinental ballistic missile.', u'At the time, Mr. Kim said the North \\u201ccan tip intercontinental ballistic rockets with more powerful nuclear warheads and keep any cesspool of evils in the Earth, including the U. S. mainland, within our striking range.', u'\\u201d On Sept. 9, the North conducted its fifth, and most powerful, nuclear test.', u'Mr. Kim later attended another ground test of a new rocket engine, exhorting his government to prepare for another rocket launch as soon as possible.', u'In November, the United Nations Security Council imposed new sanctions against the North.\"']\n"
